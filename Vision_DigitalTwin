# Vision: Enhanced Memory System Plugin for Obsidian

## Product Statement (60 words max)

**Customer:** Obsidian users wanting to enhance their knowledge management with better memory systems, particularly advanced external memory capabilities. **What they want:** Simple integration of superior memory architecture that works seamlessly within existing Obsidian workflows. **Current market:** Basic note-taking with limited memory handling. **Problem:** Standard Obsidian lacks robust external memory systems for complex cognitive tasks. **Solution:** Fork an existing open-source plugin to add enhanced memory functionality, specifically Cognee-based external memory system.

## Stakeholders and Needs

**Primary Stakeholders:**
- **Advanced Obsidian Users**: Need better memory management for complex projects
- **Research Professionals**: Require sophisticated knowledge organization systems  
- **Knowledge Workers**: Want more effective personal AI assistance

**Secondary Stakeholders:**
- **Plugin Developers**: Interested in enhancing existing tools rather than building from scratch
- **Community Contributors**: Want to improve open-source solutions
- **Future Users**: Will benefit from enhanced memory capabilities

**Needs:**
- Users: Better external memory handling for large knowledge bases
- Developers: Easy-to-integrate enhancements that don't break existing functionality  
- Community: Improved plugin ecosystem with better memory management
- Future Users: Scalable systems that can handle complex cognitive processes

## Actors and Features

**Plugin Developer/Contributor**
- Fork existing Obsidian plugin to add enhanced memory capabilities 
- Implement Cognee-style external memory system integration ( https://docs.cognee.ai/core-concepts/architecture )
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Test performance with large datasets and complex workflows

**End User (Advanced Knowledge Worker)**
- Access enhanced external memory through familiar Obsidian interface  
- Use advanced retrieval and organization features for research projects
- Benefit from improved knowledge structuring capabilities during deep work sessions
- Leverage integrated AI assistance with better memory context

## Quality Requirements (6 max)

1. **Performance**: Work stable, no crash and bugs.
2. **Compatibility**: Must work seamlessly with existing Obsidian plugins and workflows  
3. **Scalability**: Handle knowledge bases of 50K+ notes without performance degradation. In future 1-100 GB Vault size.
4. **Integration**: Smooth connection to external memory systems via MCP or direct API
5. **Reliability**: Zero data corruption during memory operations (99.9% uptime)
6. **Usability**: Minimal learning curve - enhancement should feel like natural Obsidian extension

## Technical Approach & Implementation Strategy

This project will focus on a straightforward, practical approach:

1. **Target Plugin**: Select an existing open-source Obsidian plugin that can accommodate enhanced memory functionality
2. **Memory System**: Implement Cognee-style external memory system as primary enhancement  
3. **Integration Method**: Choose between three approaches:
   - **MCP Connection**: Enable external memory access through Model Context Protocol for maximum flexibility
   - **API Integration**: Direct API calls to external memory services (simpler but less flexible)
   - **Direct Code Integration**: Modify plugin codebase directly to handle memory operations

4. **Implementation Priority**:
   - Primary goal: Enable robust external memory with better retrieval and organization than default Obsidian system
   - Secondary goals: Support multiple memory types, improved indexing, semantic search capabilities  
   - Tertiary goals: Automated knowledge structuring based on user cognitive patterns

## Why This Matters for Obsidian Users

Obsidian's core strength is building second brains through interconnected notes. However, existing systems struggle with:
- Large-scale knowledge management
- Advanced retrieval and organization beyond simple tagging
- Integration of external memory systems that maintain context
- Sophisticated AI assistance without losing local control

Our enhancement addresses these gaps by providing a superior external memory system that works within Obsidian's familiar framework.

## Expected Impact & Timeline  

**Immediate Impact**: Users gain better memory management capabilities for complex projects and research workflows  
**Short-term (30 days)**: Plugin released with core enhanced memory features
**Mid-term (90 days)**: Community adoption, feedback integration for further improvements

The solution focuses on what users actually need - a practical enhancement to existing functionality rather than grand architectural visions.

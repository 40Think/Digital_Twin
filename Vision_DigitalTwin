# Vision: Enhanced Memory System Plugin for Obsidian

## Product Statement (60 words max)

**Customer:** Obsidian users wanting to enhance their 
knowledge management with better memory systems, particularly 
advanced external memory capabilities. 
**What they want:** Simple integration of superior memory 
architecture that works seamlessly within existing Obsidian 
workflows. **Current market:** Basic note-taking with limited
memory handling. **Problem:** Standard Obsidian lacks robust 
external memory systems for complex cognitive tasks. 
**Solution:** Fork an existing open-source plugin to 
add enhanced memory functionality, specifically 
Cognee-based external memory system.

The essence for me, and for those who are on the same wavelength as me, 
this is VERY needed for these people. The quality of communication with 
AI depends very much on the quality of external memory (called RAG). 
If there's no good one - it leads to failures and irritation.
There can also be a bad RAG. Obsidian is a program for creating a 
Second Brain from markdown files and connections between them. 
Copilot and Smart Connections plugins integrate LLMs, giving you 
the ability to talk with your own Second Brain. Their weakness 
is numerous bugs and they were designed for storage systems
with 50-200 notes; if given 500-1000 notes - they crash. 
The Cognee system imitates human memory by means of vector
and graph databases along with intelligent search powered 
by LLMs within the memory itself. When integrated into these 
plugins (I've written an LLM solution for integration in a 
ticket that spans about 200 lines) - it increases the 
quality of communication with AI by orders of magnitude,
providing enormous benefit.

## Stakeholders and Needs

**Primary Stakeholders:**
- **Advanced Obsidian Users**: Need better memory management for complex projects
- **Research Professionals**: Require sophisticated knowledge organization systems  
- **Knowledge Workers**: Want more effective personal AI assistance

**Secondary Stakeholders:**
- **Plugin Developers**: Interested in enhancing existing tools rather than building from scratch
- **Community Contributors**: Want to improve open-source solutions
- **Future Users**: Will benefit from enhanced memory capabilities

**Needs:**
- Users: Better external memory handling for large knowledge bases
- Developers: Easy-to-integrate enhancements that don't break existing functionality  
- Community: Improved plugin ecosystem with better memory management
- Future Users: Scalable systems that can handle complex cognitive processes

## Actors and Features

**Plugin Developer/Contributor**
- Fork existing Obsidian plugin to add enhanced memory capabilities 
- Implement Cognee-style external memory system integration ( https://docs.cognee.ai/core-concepts/architecture )
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing functionality
- Test performance with large datasets and complex workflows

**End User (Advanced Knowledge Worker)**
- Access enhanced external memory through familiar Obsidian interface  
- Use advanced retrieval and organization features for research projects
- Benefit from improved knowledge structuring capabilities during deep work sessions
- Leverage integrated AI assistance with better memory context

## Quality Requirements (6 max)

1. **Performance**: Work stable, no crash and bugs.
2. **Compatibility**: Must work seamlessly with existing Obsidian plugins and workflows  
3. **Scalability**: Handle knowledge bases of 50K+ notes without performance degradation. In future 1-100 GB Vault size.
4. **Integration**: Smooth connection to external memory systems via MCP or direct API
5. **Reliability**: Zero data corruption during memory operations (99.9% uptime)
6. **Usability**: Minimal learning curve - enhancement should feel like natural Obsidian extension

## Technical Approach & Implementation Strategy

This project will focus on a straightforward, practical approach:

1. **Target Plugin**: Select an existing open-source Obsidian plugin that can accommodate enhanced memory functionality - Smart Connections / Smart Chat / Smart Composer OR Copilot.  
2. **Memory System**: Implement Cognee-style external memory system as primary enhancement  
3. **Integration Method**: Choose between three approaches:
   - **MCP Connection**: Enable external memory access through Model Context Protocol for maximum flexibility
   - **API Integration**: Direct API calls to external memory services (simpler but less flexible)
   - **Direct Code Integration**: Modify plugin codebase directly to handle memory operations

4. **Implementation Priority**:
   - Primary goal: Enable robust external memory with better retrieval and organization than default Obsidian system
   - Secondary goals: Support multiple memory types, improved indexing, semantic search capabilities  
   - Tertiary goals: Automated knowledge structuring based on user cognitive patterns

## Why This Matters for Obsidian Users

Obsidian's core strength is building second brains through interconnected notes. However, existing systems struggle with:
- Large-scale knowledge management
- Advanced retrieval and organization beyond simple tagging
- Integration of external memory systems that maintain context
- Sophisticated AI assistance without losing local control

Our enhancement addresses these gaps by providing a superior external memory system that works within Obsidian's familiar framework.

## Expected Impact & Timeline  

**Immediate Impact**: Users gain better memory management capabilities for complex projects and research workflows  
**Short-term (30 days)**: Plugin released with core enhanced memory features
**Mid-term (90 days)**: Community adoption, feedback integration for further improvements

The solution focuses on what users actually need - a practical enhancement to existing functionality rather than grand architectural visions.
